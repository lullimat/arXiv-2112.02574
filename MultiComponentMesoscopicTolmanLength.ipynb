    "In this paper we analyze the curvature corrections to the surface tension in the context of the Shan-Chen (SC) multi-component Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We demonstrate that the same techniques recently applied in the context of the Shan-Chen multi-phase model can be applied to multi-component mixtures. We implement, as a new application, the calculation of the surface of tension radius $R_s$ through the minimization of the generalized surface tension $\\sigma[R]$. In turn we are able to estimate the Tolman length, i.e. the first order coefficient of the curvature expansion of the surface tension $\\sigma(R)$, as well as the higher order corrections, i.e. the curvature- and the Gaussian-rigidity coefficients. The SC multi-component model allows to model both fully-symmetric as well as asymmetric interactions among the components. By performing an extensive set of simulations we present a first example of tunable Tolman length in the mesoscopic model, being zero for symmetric interactions and different from zero otherwise. This result paves the way for controlling such interface properties which are paramount in presence of thermal fluctuations. All reported results can be independently reproduced through the ``idea.deploy'' framework available at [https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy](https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy)."

    "\n",
    "This document is intended for those interested readers who want to reproduce the results reported in the paper entitled \"Mesoscale Modelling of the Tolman Length in Multi-component Systems\". In the present case the computational resources needed should be available in general, although the netire set of simulations takes a time of the order of weeks on NVIDIA P100 cards. This time can considerably be shortened when discarding the simulations of the largest droplest for $L=301$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next development steps will include a class to measure the time required by each cell and output it in a .json file which can be sent to [matteo.lulli@gmail.com](mailto:matteo.lulli@gmail.com) so that average execution times will be availble and organized according to the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each subsection can be executed independently and reproduce the results which will be stored locally in the directory 'reproduced-data', so that the data will be generated only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plots can also be generated using the same scripts employed for the figures of the paper. Since there are some issues in executing these scripts in the Jupyter environment we include them as separated files which are called from the cells themselves. **In order to reproduce the plots a working 'latex' installation is necessary to be present on the system.**\n",

The repository shall be working on the 'master' branch after the peer-review process is completed.**\n",
