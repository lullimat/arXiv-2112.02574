# Mesoscale Modelling of the Tolman Length in Multi-component Systems

Welcome to the repository!

**At present this repository has been tested only in the 'devel' branch of the 'idea.deploy' framework. In order to swicth branch please go in the root directory of 'idea.deploy' from a terminal and type ```git checkout devel```. The repository will be compatibel with the 'master' branch after peer-review process is completed.**

A Jupyter Notebook that can be used to reproduce the results will soon be uploaded to the repository.
In order to execute it is necessary to install the [idea.deploy](https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy) framework.

In order to open the present Jupyter notebook "MultiComponentMesoscopicTolmanLength.ipynb" you should perform the following steps
- install the [idea.deploy](https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy) project, following the instructions in the README.md in the section "Installation"
- load the idea.deploy python virtual environment: if you installed the bash aliases for the [idea.deploy](https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy) project you can issue the command "idpy-load"
- launch locally the Jupyter server with "idpy-jupyter"
- copy and paste in your browser the url prompted in the terminal in order to open the Jupyter server interface
- click the file "ShanChenPressureTensorIsotropy.ipynb"
- wait for all the extension to be loaded: when the notebook is loaded you should see a "Table of Contents" on the left side and the different code cells in the "folded" mode with a small grey arrow on the left

In order to excute the code content of a cell, select it and enter the key combination "shift + enter".
As of today, after much testing Google Chrome has offered the most reliable expreience in handling the notebook.

At your first time, please execute the cells in order starting from the top and following the instructions.

## Dependencies
A part from the python dependencies a working "latex" environment needs to be installed on the system in order to reproduce the plots which contain latex symbols
